# OnePageFlexibleNavigation
Building a fancy up/down navigation for a single page website working with any amount of sections: https://timsch3.github.io/OnePageFlexibleNavigation/

This is meant to become my portfolio website.

What I also want to add / try with this:
- styled scrollbar
- left/right version with hidden scrollbars
