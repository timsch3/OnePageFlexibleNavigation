# OnePageFlexibleNavigation
Building a fancy up/down navigation working with any amount of sections on a single page: https://timsch3.github.io/PortfolioPage/

It uses JavaScript to show and hide the up and down navigation areas according to where on the page the user scrolled using either the navigation itself or an input device.

This is meant to become my portfolio website.

What I also want to add / try with this:
- styled scrollbar
- left/right version with hidden scrollbars
