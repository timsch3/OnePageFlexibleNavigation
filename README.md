# OnePageFlexibleNavigation
Building a fancy up/down navigation working with any amount of sections on a single page: https://timsch3.github.io/PortfolioPage/

It uses JavaScript to show and hide the up and down navigation areas according to where on the page the user scrolled using either the navigation itself or an input device.
